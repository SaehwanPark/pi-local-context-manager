# Command reference

[Documentation portal]({{ '/' | relative_url }}) · [How to use it]({{ '/guides/how-to-use.html' | relative_url }}) · [Configuration]({{ '/reference/configuration.html' | relative_url }})

Type these commands into Pi's editor. The extension registers them when the package is loaded. If a workflow is disabled in configuration, its command explains that it is disabled instead of changing the session.

## Slash commands

| Command | Use it for | Does it change the session? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/context-stats` | View context reading/estimate, logical model window, working budget, threshold provenance, reductions, and compaction history | No. It only reports telemetry. |
| `/context-mode [profile]` | Show the current mode or choose `aggressive`, `balanced`, or `relaxed` for this session | It changes this session's policy only; it does not edit a file. |
| `/compact-phase [reason]` | Compact after a meaningful phase, such as `tests pass` or `implementation complete` | It may add Pi's normal compaction entry after Pi is idle. |
| `/handoff <objective>` | Begin a fresh session focused on a new objective | Only after you review the generated prompt and the new-session transition succeeds. |
| `/checkpoint-reset [reason]` | Archive a completed semantic episode and continue with a small capsule | Only after you review both artifacts and explicitly approve. |
| `/context-checkpoints` | List recent checkpoint archives for the current repository | No. It only reads local checkpoint metadata. |

Pi's built-in `/compact` remains available for ordinary or custom-instruction compaction. The extension does not replace it.

## Examples

Inspect the session:

```text
/context-stats
```

Choose a more conservative policy when a long local-model session becomes slow:

```text
/context-mode aggressive
```

Return to the default or allow longer working contexts:

```text
/context-mode balanced
/context-mode relaxed
```

To persist a choice across sessions, set `contextProfile` in `pi-local-context-manager.json`; see [Configuration]({{ '/reference/configuration.html' | relative_url }}).

Mark the end of a phase:

```text
/compact-phase implementation complete; tests pass
```

Start a new focus without carrying every detail forward:

```text
/handoff investigate the remaining release issue
```

Archive a completed episode before continuing the project:

```text
/checkpoint-reset v0.3.0 release completed
```

Find local archives:

```text
/context-checkpoints
```

Reasons are short labels for the generated summary and filename. Do not put secrets in a reason; checkpoint content can already contain sensitive project details.

`aggressive` is for sluggish growing sessions, `balanced` is the default, and `relaxed` is for sessions that compact more often than needed. Profiles scale with the usable working budget; a configured/runtime effective budget can constrain a larger advertised window, and small windows retain response headroom.

## Model-facing tools

These are available to the model during an agent run. You usually do not type them yourself.

### `request_context_compaction`

The model can call this after a meaningful task phase. It accepts an optional short `reason`:

```json
{
  "reason": "implementation and tests complete"
}
```

The tool queues a request for the end of the current agent run. It does not compact in the middle of a tool call. Pi may skip the request if the session is not idle, another compaction is running, cooldown is active, or the native history is too small to summarize. These are best-effort decisions; a failed request releases the gate with a retry backoff and the active session remains available.

### `request_context_reset`

The model can call this after a major completed episode. It accepts an optional short `reason`:

```json
{
  "reason": "PR merged"
}
```

This tool records only a recommendation. It never writes a checkpoint, starts a new session, or bypasses the user's review. After the agent settles, the user can decide whether to run `/checkpoint-reset`.

## What counts as a boundary?

Good reasons to use a boundary command include:

- implementation and its tests are complete;
- an investigation or debugging episode is resolved;
- a PR has been merged;
- a release or deployment is complete;
- the next task is meaningfully different.

Avoid forcing a boundary during active debugging or after every small edit. If you still need the details in the next few turns, keep the current context or use ordinary `/compact` with a focused instruction.

## If a command is unavailable

1. Confirm the package is installed with `pi list`.
2. Start a new Pi session or run `/reload`.
3. Check `pi config` for a disabled extension.
4. Review [Configuration]({{ '/reference/configuration.html' | relative_url }}) for a disabled feature or untrusted project override.
